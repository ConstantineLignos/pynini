"""Implementation of paradigms, mirroring and extending functionality in Thrax.

This follows the treatment of morphology in chapter 2 of:

Roark, B. and Sproat, R. 2007. Computational Approaches to Morphology and
Syntax. Oxford: Oxford University Press.

Following that work, all affixation is treated via composition, since that is
the most general single regular operation that can handle morphological
processes. For example, suffixing an "s" to a word, with a morpheme boundary "+"
is modeled as the following "shape":

sigma ("" : "+s")

i.e. an insertion of "+s" after anything, where sigma represents a string
of any symbol except the boundary symbol. If one wanted to also constrain the
stem to be of a particular shape (e.g. comparative affixation in English, where
a stem must be at most two syllables long) or even to modify the stem to be a
particular shape (as in Yowlumne --- cf. Archangeli, D. 1984. Underspecification
in Yawelmani Phonology and Morphology. PhD Thesis, MIT) then one can replace
sigma with a more restrictive acceptor or transducer.

A paradigm consists of:

- A Category.
- A list of ParadigmSlots, which are combinations of a FeatureVector from the
  Category and a "shape" as above.
- A specification of what FeatureVector corresponds to the "lemma". For example
  in Latin nouns it would be "[case=nom][num=sg]". In Latin verbs it is the
  first person singular indicative active.
- An optional name.
- An optional set of rewrite rules to apply to forms in the paradigm.
- A boundary symbol.
- An optional parent paradigm from which this paradigm inherits.

Stems that are added to the system (function: set_stems_to_forms()) are composed
with all of the slot entries so that an FST is produced that maps from stems to
all of their possible forms, with boundary symbols and features. Thus, for a
Latin first declension noun:

    aqu -> aqu+a[case=nom][num=sg]
    aqu -> aqu+ae[case=gen][num=sg]
    aqu -> aqu+am[case=acc][num=sg]

etc. Call this "stem_to_forms".

The Paradigm then defines a few common operations:

1. Analyzer:

This is the output projection of the stem_to_forms, composed with an FST that
deletes boundary labels and features, and then inverted. Thus this maps from,
e.g.:

    aquam -> aqu+am[case=acc][num=sg]

2. Tagger:

Same as the Analyzer, but omitting the decomposition of the word into parts:

    aquam -> aquam[case=acc][num=sg]

3. Lemmatizer:

The lemmatizer is constructed by taking stem_to_forms, moving the feature labels
to the input side, inverting (so it maps from fully-formed word to stem +
features), then inflecting the stem as the lemma. Thus:

    aquam -> aqua[case=acc][num=sg]

4. Inflector.

This is the inverse of the lemmatizer:

    aqua[case=acc][num=sg] -> aquam
